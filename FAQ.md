## Frequently Asked Questions

### Install Issues

##### I am getting a "Does not appear to be a valid font" error message when I attempt to install on Windows 10.  How do I fix this?

Reported in https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/issues/24

Turn your firewall on, then attempt to install the font again.


### Appearance Issues

##### The oblique style does not look correct in my JetBrains text editor (IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, etc) on OS X.  What is going on?

Reported in https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack/issues/26

This is a known issue with the Java renderer in these editors and not an issue with the font.  This has been reported on the JetBrains issue tracker.  Updates will be posted to the above issue report.
